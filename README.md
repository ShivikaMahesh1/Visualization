## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the automobile company  understand the digital performance of their 31 channel partner's of North India Region better. It helps monitor the performance of the channel partners in digital marketing and helps recognize gap areas to achieve the business objective.

Since, the number of retail is only 2000 for 39000 enquiries generated through digital using Google and Meta ads thus dealerships must work on improving their conversion.
